      <br><br>"Happy birthday to an amazing friend! I want to start by saying how sorry I am for my mistakes and the hurt I caused. I know I let you down, and for that, I'm truly sorry. On your special day, I want to acknowledge my wrongs and promise to make things right. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me and that we can move forward together. You deserve all the happiness in the world, and I hope your birthday is just the beginning of an incredible year.
